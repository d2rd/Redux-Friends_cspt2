## Project

* For this project you'll need to create a few React components that will interact with your Redux state.
* This app can all be built in terms of a single view made up of multiple components. Some components will be connected to your Redux Store and others will get their data passed down as props from the connected components.

## Initialize Project

* [x] Run `yarn` or `npm i` inside the root directory of this project to install dependencies.
* [x] Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the API server.
* [x] Run `create-react-app friends` in a separate terminal window in the root directory of the project to create your starter application.
* [x] `cd` into the _friends_ folder and type `yarn add redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-logger axios` or `npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-logger axios`, which will install the needed dependencies.
* You will create a list of your friends using React and Redux.

* It's really is up to you how you build this project. I suggest 

* [x] write down the flow you want to follow
      1. Create components
      2. Create action creators
      3. Create reducers
      4. Create root reducer
      5. Create Redux store
      6. Make import statements
      7. Make connections

* WORKFLOW 
      1. [x] Create components and related folders
          src/
            - App.js
            components/
              - FriendsList.js
              - FriendForm.js
              - CreateFriendForm.js
              - UpdateFriendForm.js
              - SelectedFriend.js
      1b. []  Refactor App.js
              modify root <div>
      2. [] Create action creators
            actions/
              index.js

      3. [] Create reducers
            reducers/
              - friendsReducer.js
              - index.js
              - singleFriendReducer.js
         [] Create root reducer (see tip below) in index.js

      4. [] Create Redux store in App.js
    
      5. [] Use the Provider component from `react-redux` to pass the store to your root component.

      6. []  `connect` the React components that need access to the store.

      7. [] hook up the store using the `Provider` tag inside of `src/index.js`, passing it your root reducer.

      8. [] Use `redux-thunk` as a middleware inside of `src/index.js`. Be sure to pass it to `applyMiddleware()` then feed it into your createStore function.

      9. [] (Optional) include `redux-logger` to your middleware. You're going to have plenty of action creators that will consume our API so you'll get plenty of actions triggered.

* [] write down each individual piece you need for each step in the flow:
  * (ie step 3, build containers - import connect, write mapStateToProps function, import action creators and pass them to connect, etc. etc.) so that this process doesn't feel as overwhelming.

## Root Reducer and our State Tree

* 3b. [] Your initial state **could** (but doesn't have to) look something like this:

```js
{
  fetchingFriends: false,
  friendsFetched: false,
  friendsSaved: false,
  savingFriends: false,
  updatingFriend: false,
  friendUpdated: false,
  deletingFriend: false,
  friendDeleted: false,
  friends: [],
  error: null
}
```

* This is a pretty large state tree, but each field is extremely simple.
* All of your items in your state tree represent a make up of actions that you're going to make asynchronously. Think about your application and the state you need. This root reducer object will represent that state.

* [] Each `friend` item that is in the `friends` array should have the following format:

```js
{
  id: 1
  name: 'Joe',
  age: 24,
  email: 'joe@lambdaschool.com',
}
```

## No need for a router here. We can fit all we need into one page with some proper styling and layout decisions.

* [] Your component tree **could** (but doesn't have to) look a like this.

```
index.js
  - App.js
    - Friends.js
    - CreateFriendForm.js
    - UpdateFriendForm.js
```

* [] create multiple components and `connect` them all up to your `redux` state tree. 
* [] component who's sole purpose is to render a form for updating a user
* [] component who's sole purpose is for creating users
* [] component who's sole purpose is to delete a user.


#### App.js

* [] Inside of `App.js` do the friend fetching for your _friends_ data from within `componentDidMount()`. You'll need to call an action creator that you build in order to fetch your friends. A crude example of what this could potentially look like would be:
  ![Bad example](https://image.ibb.co/hpg7gw/Screen_Shot_2018_01_24_at_1_07_21_PM.png)
* []  You **Definitely** want to style your application to look much better than mine!

## Stretch Problem

* In the requirements for this project, we implemented a GET operation and a POST operation. 

* [] Add actions for making a PUT request
* [] Add action for making a DELETE request.
* [] Style the friends list and the input field and make everything look nice.
* [] Expand the number of properties that you put on each friend object. 
* [] Feel free to remove the dummy data on the server or modify it in any way.
